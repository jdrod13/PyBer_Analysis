# PyBer_Analysis


##PyBer Project


### Overview of Project
  
  
  
  **On this project, we collaborated with PyBer, a python-based ridesharing where one of our first steps is to create an exploratory analysis on data in some huge CVS file. To aid this process, we will make several types of visualizations o tell a compelling story. We are going to do our work by using python scrips using pandaâ€™s libraries and Matplotlib to create a variety of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city.**



### Purpose
   
   
   
   **The purpose of this work is to report findings on the data analyzed and to help Omar create a DataFrame summary of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we are going to be able to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total week fares for each city type; we also are going summarize with the demonstration of our report how the data differs by city type and how decision-makers can use those differences at PyBer. From Pyber. The analysis and visualization we produce will help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. This analysis would help the school board and superintendent in deciding on the school budget and priorities while maintaining and high level of confidentiality to protect the students that we are reporting on.**


## Analysis 
     

## Results
   
   
   **Our studies and analysis of the data demonstrate an essential dominance of rides and drivers in urban cities since cities have a more robust presence of a high volume of people at one time than suburban cities and rural areas.**

   **The effectiveness of our analysis demonstrates that although rural areas have fewer rides, their fares are still pricey even there a notable representation of fewer drivers available to the public where the density of population is less in comparison to suburban cities where they have more drivers available than the rural areas but less than urban areas. Urban cities happen to have lower fare prices but much more rides in demand.**

-	What do our findings represent?



**It is extraordinary that our findings represent more than 60% of the rides demanded from urban areas while just 5% are from rural areas. Our analysis represents an average number of rides for urban areas three times more than in rural; Pyber app is considerably more notable by far at places with a high concentration of people where we can use big cities as a perfect representation of our point. Urban areas have five times more drivers than rural areas; it has a far more significant driver presence in the suburban regions not as big as urban areas. We clearly understand that there is a notable imbalance in the distribution of drivers across city types.**



### Pyber Total Fare by City Type

**Our graph is an excellent demonstration of what weekly fares for all city types in 3 months period of behaviors looked like in 2019. We can imply that the sum of fares for urban cities was more than 1800 dollars, equal to about three times the maximum value for rural towns. On the other hand, suburban cities happen to have 1500 dollars in total for that period. It is essential to explain that this graph also demonstrates that the urban sum of fares was relatively higher because the sum of foods accounts for all the riders during the three months.**





 
 ### Summary


What are the advantages and recommendations that could contribute to PyBer operations?



-	**If PyBer is looking to increase their presence in suburban and rural areas, they must stimulate and encourage people to become new drives and ultimately bring the count higher; having more drivers would increase the revenue by a notable amount as fares are highly-priced in rural cities**





-  **Another recommendation is creating more incentives for people located in suburban areas that could contribute to getting more drivers to offer better and quality services that would also help the growth and popularity of the PyBer app that makes a notable increase in sales and better NPS scores.**






-	**Last but not least, We recommend finding a better balance between drives and rides in urban areas; this could be done by decreasing the driver count by a small amount. However, this would also bring the average fare price in urban areas higher as there might be less supply to cover the volume of demand in rides.**
